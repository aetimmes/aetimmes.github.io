I've written about a dozen versions of this post, one for each iteration of whatever new self-hosting setup I've cooked up.

But after my basement flooded this past year, I've finally relented and moved my writing off of some bare-metal server in my basement and put it in a git repository on a cloud service where I never have to think about the physical hardware ever again.

More to come anon.
